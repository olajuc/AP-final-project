        Pluto.markets is new player on the investing market. Our mission is to
        create a social, innovative investing app for the new generation of

      <h1>What are we building at Pluto?</h1>
      <p>
        As more people are investing, more people are also naturally talking
        about it. Investing has become social!! In particular, this is happening
        among groups of friends who use WhatsApp, Telegram, Messenger or similar
        applications to exchange view on the markets and share new interesting
        investment opportunities! At Pluto we are building the leading investing
        app for friend-groups enabling them to collaborate, compete and
        co-invest powered by fractional shares and zero-commission trading.
        Having the ability to share information with ease is one step towards
        increased financial literacy and can make the experience much mere
        engaging. Perhaps even fun! ðŸ¥³ We have higher conviction than ever
        before that the future of investing is social and the timing is now,
        with a new digital generation entering the stock markets quicker than
        ever before.

      <h1>Why are we different?</h1>
      <p>
        What makes it very unique is the social aspect of this application,
        where you can actually create an investing club with your closest
        friends, which means you can communicate and debate about your trades or
        the latest market changes. Pluto's mission is to, firstly, encourage
        more people to start investing since that's one of the most rapidly
        growing markets right now. Secondly, make sure when people invest, they
        are actually making more educated decisions by enriching it with
        financial data. See your friends' portfolios and get notified when they
        make a move that you might copy.
